Overview: This program will act as a scanner and a recursive descent parser for json files using the C language.

Usage: `$ <EXECUTABLE> <FILENAME>` <br><br>
Example: `./a.out sample1.json` <br><br>
Output: If the file is parsed, the terminal will print all the tokens that were matched and the line they are found on. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
        If the file cannot be parsed, the terminal will print the type of error and what line the error was found.
